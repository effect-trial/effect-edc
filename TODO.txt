- Other (reported by JA):
    - Consent 2 and 3 – makes you add the name in full caps. Can this be made auto?
    - Requisition for blood sample gave server error – this prevents saving the bloods form.
    - I then added the requisition 992FC4G – thinking this was for a sample taken, but it seemed to only be for a FBC – and did not let me use it for chemistry results.
    - LP details – are these available?
