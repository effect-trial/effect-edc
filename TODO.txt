    - reconcile with provided CRF (09_Death_Form_110821_V0.5.pdf)
    - if death, required:
        - SAE CRF
        - Death CRF
        - Termination CRF
        - Adherence
        - Clinical Assessment CRF

- Medical History CRF:
    - currently taking TB treatment?  -> Ask which treatment, like asked on D14 - use same list
    - validate

- ARV History CRF:
    - split?
    - remove singular choices, convert m2m to autocomplete field
    - store regimen history in inline (i.e. ~Q9-Q13 for each)
    - remove CD4 (collected at baseline), add estimated_date q to screening
    - add "What decision was made at enrollment regarding their current ART regimen?" (ART continued/ART stopped)
    - validate

- Requisitions:
    - combine renal (RFT) and liver (LFT) function tests into single requisition
        - combine results forms

- Subject visit:
    - Hide 'survival_status' at baseline
        - trigger AE_INITIAL_ACTION/DEATH_REPORT_ACTION if answer YES to 'survival_status'
    - Hide 'hospitalized' at baseline
        - trigger AE_INITIAL_ACTION if answer YES to 'hospitalized'

- Follow-up CRF:
    - Remove model, form, admin and test once validation transferred over

- Study Medication CRF:
    - capture initial prescription
    - capture time_of_first_dose ???[4am, 10am, 4pm, 10pm]
    - capture modifications at subsequent visits (e.g. "Were there modifications to the study medication?")

- Signs and Symptoms CRF:
    - validate 'any_sx' != UNKNOWN if an in-person or telephone-based (patient) visit
    - 'headache_duration_microseconds' to be calculated (DurationField) based on headache_duration (DDdHHh`, `DDd` or `HHh` str)
    - look at basic validation for _sx_other fields

- Mental Status CRF:
    - trigger AE_INITIAL_ACTION if answer YES to 'reportable_as_ae' or 'patient_admitted'

- Vital Signs CRF:
    - add, "Was blood pressure taken?" / "If not, why?"
    - validate:
        - blood pressure gradable if >= 180 / 110 (either value)
        - Temperature G3 if temp >= 39.3 and < 40
        - Temperature G4 if temp >= 40

- Significant Diagnoses CRF:
    - add validation
    - trigger AE_INITIAL_ACTION if answer YES to 'gi_side_effects'
    - trigger AE_INITIAL_ACTION if answer YES to 'reportable_as_ae' or 'patient_admitted'

- ARV Treatment CRF:
    - add validation

- Patient Treatment CRF:
    - if Q4 'cm_confirmed' is YES
        - remove from study treatment
        - remain in follow-up
        - validate with study medication, to confirm taken off drug
    - if 'lp_completed', prompt for LP results

- Blood Result: FBC CRF:
    - Q3, 'requisition' + button doesn't work (no panels are listed)
    - ???validation

- Economics CRF:
    - update
    - 2 CRFs:
        - everyone to complete same CRF at baseline, and end of study
        - everyone who has a medical event with any costs to them or trial to complete different CRF
            - then as PRN at subsequent follow-ups
    - Question: Has there been any events since last visit?

- Viral load CRF/PRN:
    - implement
    - schedule
    - validate

- Adherence CRF:
    - form validation (all)
        - consider adding "Are you speaking to patient?" lead question to validate against

- Adherence Diary
    - 14 days, 4 doses per day, reason for missed dose
    - user confirm number of missed doses (EDC to validate)
    - user confirm if there are 2 or more consecutive missed doses (EDC to validate)
    - if not filled in on D14 visit, EDC to prompts, until it is

- Missed Visit CRF:
    - awaiting

- Protocol violation/deviation CRF
    - awaiting

- End of Study/Termination CRF:
    - reconcile with provided form (08_Termination_Form_110821_V0.5.pdf)
    - add validation
    - check if started treatment, cannot be late exclusion

- Other (reported by JA):
    - Consent 2 and 3 – makes you add the name in full caps. Can this be made auto?
    - Requisition for blood sample gave server error – this prevents saving the bloods form.
    - I then added the requisition 992FC4G – thinking this was for a sample taken, but it seemed to only be for a FBC – and did not let me use it for chemistry results.
    - LP details – are these available?
