- SAE:
    - Reconcile with provided form (07_Serious_Adverse_Event_Form_110821_V0.5.pdf)
    - Remove references to thrombophlebitis, and hospital acquired pneumonia

- Death CRF:
    - Reconcile with provided CRF (09_Death_Form_110821_V0.5.pdf)

- LP CRF:

- Microbiology CRF:
    - Mirror CRF from Ambition, but move CSF into LP CRF

- Requisitions:
    - combine renal (RFT) and liver (LFT) function tests into single requisition
        - combine results forms

- Follow-up CRF:
    - validate can't have in-person or telephone-based patient visit if visit report specified based on 'Collateral History ...'
    - if deceased, tigger death report action, and end of study report

- Signs and Symptoms CRF:
    - validate any_sx != UNKNOWN if an in-person or telephone-based patient visit
    - headache_duration_microseconds to be calculated (DurationField) based on headache_duration (DDdHHh`, `DDd` or `HHh` str)
    - if cm_sx_lp_done, generate LP
    - if fbc or chem bloods taken, generate requisition
    - request _sx other fields be comma-separated, and look at basic validation

- Neurological Symptoms CRF:
    - merge all fields into Signs and Symptoms CRF
        - merge focal_neurologic_deficits into SiSx
            - prefix all with 'Neuro'
        - merge 'meningism' and 'papilloedema' into SiSx list
        - order SiSx alphabetically


- Mental Status CRF:

- Vital Signs CRF:
    - blood pressure gradable if >= 180 / 110 (either value)
    - Temperature G3 if temp >= 39.3 and < 40
    - Temperature G4 if temp >= 40

- Economics CRF:
    - update
    - 2 CRFs:
        - everyone to complete same CRF at baseline, and end of study
        - everyone who has a medical event with any costs to them or trial to complete different CRF
            - then as PRN at subsequent follow-ups
    - Question: Has there been any events since last visit?

- Study Treatment / Patient Treatment CRF:
    - refactor from study treatment to patient treatment
    - if Q4 (cm_confirmed) is YES
        - remove from study treatment
        - remain in follow-up
        - validate with study medication, to confirm taken off drug

- End of Study/Termination CRF:
    - check if started treatment, cannot be late exclusion

- Other (reported by JA):
    - Consent 2 and 3 – makes you add the name in full caps. Can this be made auto?
    - Requisition for blood sample gave server error – this prevents saving the bloods form.
    - I then added the requisition 992FC4G – thinking this was for a sample taken, but it seemed to only be for a FBC – and did not let me use it for chemistry results.
    - LP details – are these available?
